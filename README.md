# Visual Data Science project
This repo contains source code for the project I did in the [Visual Data Science](https://tiss.tuwien.ac.at/course/courseDetails.xhtml?dswid=9736&dsrid=772&courseNr=186868&semester=2022W) course at TU Wien (2022W).

## Install

### Data exploration stuff
If you have conda installed this is easy: just run

```bash
conda create -f environment.yml
conda activate sejmouvisds
```

This will create and activate a conda environment with Python 3.10 and all the required package dependencies for the stuff I did with Python. So, afterwards it should be possible to also run all the data exploration scripts and notebooks in `data-exploration`.

More info might follow later...
