# Create T3 App

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.

## What's next? How do I make an app with this?

We try to keep this project as simple as possible, so you can start with just the scaffolding we set up for you, and add additional things later when they become necessary.

If you are not familiar with the different technologies used in this project, please refer to the respective docs. If you still are in the wind, please join our [Discord](https://t3.gg/discord) and ask for help.

## local Postgres setup (TODO: complete docs later)
```sql
CREATE DATABASE spotify_db;
CREATE USER spotify_admin WITH PASSWORD 'yourpass';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE spotify_db TO spotify_admin;
```

add in `.env`:
```
postgresql://spotify_admin:yourpass@localhost/spotify_db
```

## differences with MySQL
use `mysql` in connection string instead of `postgresql`

for user creation and granting privileges, use
```sql
CREATE USER 'spotify_admin'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'yourpass';
USE spotify_db;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON * TO 'spotify_admin'@'localhost';
```
